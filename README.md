# PHP Scripts and Projects Repository

Welcome to my PHP repository, where I will be uploading exercises and projects as I work through different areas of PHP development. This repository will showcase both my learning progress and various PHP projects that I am building.

## Sections

1. **Ejercicios**: A collection of exercises designed to practice and improve fundamental PHP skills. These scripts cover various PHP concepts such as variables, arrays, loops, functions, and more.
2. **proyecto-blog**: A simple blog project built using PHP. This project includes features such as post creation, editing, deletion, and basic user authentication. It is designed to demonstrate how to build a dynamic web application using PHP and MySQL.
3. **proyecto-tienda**: An online store project developed in PHP. This project includes product listing, shopping cart functionality, checkout processes, and database interaction for storing product and user information.

## How to Use

Each section of the repository contains its own folder with specific scripts and files for that topic or project. Hereâ€™s how you can run them:

### Running **Ejercicios**

The **Ejercicios** folder contains various PHP scripts that can be run individually. To execute these scripts, you can either:

1. Set up a local PHP server (e.g., using XAMPP or MAMP), place the scripts in the `htdocs` folder, and access them via your web browser.
2. Alternatively, you can run the scripts directly in your terminal if you have PHP installed by using the command:
   ```bash php filename.php
